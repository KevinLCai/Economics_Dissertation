# Economics_Dissertation

This is my Economics dissertation written with the help of the University College London Economics Department. 

This academic research is outdated and was conducted during a time when there was very little cryptocurrency and blockchain literature. As a result, many of my opinions given in this paper are outdated and contain innacuracies within the space. For instance, in the paper I claim that Ethereum ran on a Proof of Stake mechanism back in 2021, this of course was only true for the Beacon Chain. I do not hold the opinion that central banks should issue CBDCs due to their potential to corrupt privacy and the self custody of assets. Also, I may have overhyped ICOs a bit lol.

I have many more criticisms of my own work, however, believe that it still raises thought provoking commentary on our ever-evolving monetary system.
